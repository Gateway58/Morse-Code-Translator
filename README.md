# Morse-Code-Translator
Does what you think it does. Very Low level, it only runs in terminal. If you want to make a gui yourself, you can reuse the code of course :). (But maybe tag me or somthing like that) 
New Letter: 1 Space.
New Word: 2 Space. (in Morse Code mode only in normal language you can just type normal as you usually would)  
I have one update planned, but don't know when it will be happening.Maybe in 3 -2 Weeks or maybe longer.
Hope it helps you.
